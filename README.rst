UFalcon - Ultra Fast Lightcone

(`Sgier et al. 2019 <https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2019/01/044>`_)

Package for constructing full-sky lightcones from N-Body simulation output. Written in Python 3.


NOTE: The normalization factor 1/D(delta_z)**2 from the Born approximation has been integrated into the lensing_weights.
      Package internal scripts have been adjusted for this.

N-Body Simulations
--------

Currently supported N-Body simulation code are:

* `PKDGRAV3 <https://bitbucket.org/dpotter/pkdgrav3/src/master/>`_ in lightcone mode (`Potter et al. 2016 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08621>`_)

* `L-PICOLA <https://cullanhowlett.github.io/l-picola/>`_ in lightcone mode (`Howlett et al. 2015 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03737>`_)
